Q1.(a) Drawbacks of the ForwardElimination algorithm:
	There can be zero division error in finding the scaling factor if the choices of pivots contains a zero. Also if the pivot values contain big real values
	then there can be round-off error due to large scaling factors. There is no row swapping facility in the algorithm to select the best pivot row.
   (b) The BetterForwardElimination algorithm remedy all the above drawbacks by incorporating the facility to select the best pivot row and with the smallest scaling factor value that
	is greater than zero. This facility in implemented by implementing a row swapping feature.
Q2. The BetterForwardElimination algorithm fails to provide the solution for the given equations as it only tries to solve for those system of equations which are linearly independent
	and have a unique solution. The provided system of equations isn't linearly independent and contains infinitely many solutions. To remedy this shortcoming, we can incorporate
	a facility in our routine to check whether a system is linearly independent or dependent and solve them accordingly. If the system has no solutions then it should print that.
